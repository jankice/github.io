<p>Some times an observable produces event so quickly that an observer downstream canâ€™t keep up with them. When this happens, youâ€™ll often experience a <code class="highlighter-rouge">MissingBackpressureException</code>.</p>

<p><strong>So we can say that, Backpressure is simply the process of handling a fast item producer.</strong></p>

<p>Take a quick look of basics to continue with this topic.</p>

<p><strong>Observable</strong>: It emits the values.</p>

<p><strong>Observer</strong>: It gets the values from observable. How ? - observer gets the emitted values from observable by subscribing on it.</p>

<p><strong>difference between subscriber and observer.</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In Rx Java 1  Subscriber allows to subscribe and unsubscribe, where an Observer only allows to subscribe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Rx Java 2 Observer is used to subscribe to an Observable, and Subscriber is used to subscribe to a Flowable. And if you want to be able to unsubscribe, you need to use ResourceObserver and ResourceSubscriber respectively.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So combining all the things, Backpressure is</p>

<p>When you have an observable which emits items so fast that consumer canâ€™t keep up with the flow leading to the existence of emitted but unconsumed items.
How are the unconsumed items, emitted by observables but not consumed by subscribers, managed and controlled is what backpressure strategy deals with.
Since, it requires system resources to handle backpressure, you <strong>need to choose right backpressure strategy that suits your requirement.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In Other words:</strong>
Backpressure relates to a feedback mechanism through which the subscriber can signal to the producer how much data it can consume and so to produce only that amount.</p>

<p>There are some techniques to manage backpressure. I will demonstrate those. 
But before that lets create <code class="highlighter-rouge">MissingBackpressureException</code>.</p>

<p>Which kind of observable creates a situation of backpressure?</p>

<p>There are two kind of observables that we can create</p>

<p><strong>1. Cold observable:</strong> Cold observables begin emitting sequence of items as and when the observer demands from it. Without disrupting the integrity of the sequence. ColdÂ ObservablesÂ do pull model of processing. 
Examples: database query, file retrieval, or web request.</p>

<p><strong>2. Hot observable:</strong> A hotÂ ObservableÂ begins generating items and emits them immediately when they are created. HotÂ ObservableÂ emits items at its own speed, and it is up to its observers to keep up.
When theÂ ObserverÂ is not able to consume items as quickly as they are produced by anÂ ObservableÂ they need to buffered or handled in some other way, as they will fill up the memory, finally causingÂ <code class="highlighter-rouge">OutOfMemoryException</code>.
Example: mouse &amp; keyboard events, system events, or stock prices.</p>

<p>First create a print function for simple printing argument.</p>
<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">print</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Integer</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="o">)</span>

        <span class="c1">//cause observable to fill up with items quicker that </span>

    <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, Lets start with cold observable example
the observer is taking elements only when it is ready to process that item and items do not need to be buffered in an observable because they are requested in a pull fashion. So, if you create an observable based on static range of elements from one to million, that observable would emit the same sequence of items no matter how frequently  those  items are observed.</p>
<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">String</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="nc">InterruptedException</span>

<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Output: 
print integer: 1

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In above cold observables do not need to have any form of backpressure because they working in a pull fashion.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s consider an example of hot observable that is producing a million items to a consumer that is processing those items at a slower rate, theÂ ObservableÂ is starting to fill up a memory with items, causing a program to fail:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="err">`</span><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">String</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="nc">InterruptedException</span>

    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">1000000</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++)</span> 
    <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="n">source</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">onNext</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
    
    <span class="nc">Thread</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">sleep</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">10000</span><span class="o">);</span> <span class="c1">//  thread will sleep for 10 sec.</span>
<span class="o">}</span><span class="err">`</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this program will fail with aÂ MissingBackpressureExceptionÂ because we didnâ€™t define a way of handling fast producingÂ Observable.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; print integer: 0
io.reactivex.exceptions.MissingBackpressureException: Could not emit value due to lack of requests
	at io.reactivex.processors.PublishProcessor$PublishSubscription.onNext(PublishProcessor.java:364)
	at io.reactivex.processors.PublishProcessor.onNext(PublishProcessor.java:243)
	at com.task.rxdemo.Backpressure.main(Backpressure.java:18)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here are some technique to overcome with this kind of exception. Detail explanation in next section.</p>

<p><strong>1. Collecting Items:</strong> In this technique items are collected and emitted as a collection using operators.
			This way consumer (subscriber/observer) receives collection of items which are emitted by source Observable, and it is up to consumer to decide which items to process out of the collection.</p>

<p><strong>2. Reactive pull:</strong> In this strategy Subscriber request required number of items from Observable. by calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">request()</code>.</p>

<p><strong>3. Backpressure mode:</strong></p>

<p><strong>4. Reducing no of items:</strong> Sometimes App dosnâ€™t need all the items emitted by observable. In this case reduce no of items which are emitted by observable using <code class="highlighter-rouge">take()</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">debounce()</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">range()</code>.</p>
